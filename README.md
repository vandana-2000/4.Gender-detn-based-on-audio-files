Created a feature to predict the gender using the audio file where we can record a voice as well as upload a voice note in the model.
It should not work if the voice note contains word "HI" and throw an message as this contains word "HI" upload or record voice note without "HI" as well as the voice note should be more than 30 seconds other this model should not work.If the voice note is blank we should ask user to speak
and it will come as pop up message while recording in process.
